# My Life

## 1. Inception Phase

### 1.1. Context

The use of information and communication technologies in the health area is being explored in the most diverse scenarios of diagnosis and treatment of patients.

In the last decade, there has been a proliferation of mobile devices for monitoring vital signs and physical activity of citizens, thus enhancing the emergence of a new paradigm for monitoring clinical conditions and behavioural habits.

On the other hand, it is known that patterns of food consumption have a major impact on health conditions and that more and more citizens are concerned with monitoring their diet, recording the calories and macronutrients they consume and also the calories they spend on physical exercise.

### 1.2. Problem

Due to the growing demand of the labour market, the day-to-day tasks that increasingly fill citizens' schedules and other activities that make up daily life, people have less and less time to monitor their health and perform activities to promote a good lifestyle.

Various technologies on the market try to assist people in this area by providing tools where it is possible to insert the foods consumed daily, but manual insertion is still time-consuming and takes up a large amount of time.

Gymnasiums and personal trainers try to instil a culture of exercise and a healthy lifestyle in citizens, but the prices and the high number of people who frequent this space end up discouraging many citizens from practising a healthy lifestyle.

### 1.3. Goal

This project aims to provide an intuitive and effective way to monitor a person's diet and further assist them in the practice of physical exercise, correcting the user when necessary.

With this objective in mind, we intend to develop a web information system that allows the integrated collection and visualization of clinical data sources, physical activity and eating habits related to a citizen's daily life.

The solution should proceed to the automatic collection of different types of data, such as vital signs, regular motor activity, specific physical exercises and ingested food.

On the other hand, the application should allow simplified registration of basic physical and mental health conditions of the person, such as pain in the organ or limb, depression, anxiety, fatigue, etc.

### 1.5. Expected Results

At the end of this project, we expect to have a fully functional application capable of tracking eating habits and physical activity of an individual.

This product will be capable of connecting with fitness trackers (Fitbit Charge 3) and other instruments that will measure data such as the number of steps walked, heart rate, quality of sleep, steps climbed, and other personal metrics involved in fitness.

The user will have the opportunity to track calories, macronutrients and other metrics. By taking a picture of the food, the app will automatically log the calories, proteins, carbohydrates and other metrics for future review by the user. 

The application will be capable of recording workout plans and give you feedback about your performance and posture at the end of the training.

Besides that our users will be connected to a medic that will have access to all the food and workout history of the patient so he can give more precise feedback.
